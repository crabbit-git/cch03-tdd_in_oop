# What's this then?

This is the third weekend homework assignment from the software development course I'm doing at the moment. It's just some practice setting up classes for object-oriented programming in Python, but specifically, within the context of test-driven development. The idea being that we write tests first, then write code that passes those tests. Planning is obviously the key thing here.

# Right but like... what is it?

Oh. It's kinda like Netflix but worse.

An end user Account contains one or more Profiles and each Profile can contain favourite Movies if the user choses to add some. There are classes for Account, Profile, and Movie to model these relationships.

There is no frontend here, it's literally just class definitions and tests to make sure the relationships between the classes work as intended.

If you want to run the tests, you can run `run_tests.py` from a terminal. That's about it.
